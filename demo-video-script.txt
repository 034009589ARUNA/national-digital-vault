[TIMING: 0:15 - 0:30] PROBLEM STATEMENT
─────────────────────────────────────
"Traditional paper documents are fragile. They can be lost, 
stolen, or destroyed in disasters. 

Citizens face identity crises when originals are missing. 
How can you prove your qualifications if your degree is lost?

We need a secure, immutable solution - and that's exactly 
what DocVault provides."

Notice the document preview - we verify the file before upload.
[PAUSE - show preview feature]

Once submitted, our AI checks for authenticity, then the document 
hash is stored immutably on the blockchain. 

[CLICK UPLOAD]

Here's the success animation [WAIT for confetti], and the blockchain 
transaction confirmation. Your document is now permanently protected."
